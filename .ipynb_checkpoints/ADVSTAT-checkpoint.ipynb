    "Unsolicited bulk e-mail which are sent to thousands  of recipients, is becoming common. Anyone with an e-mail will most likely have encountered or at least been sent these e-mails called \"spam\". Spam is annoying and sent by marketers in order to entice unsuspecting people into clicking links for many purposes unknown to them. Apart from wasting time, spam costs money to users\n",

    "There are many anti-spam filters available however, they rely mostly on manually constructed patternmatching. These systems need to be maintained in order to match a user's incoming message. This method requires both time and expertise. It would stand to reason that a system that would learn automatically to separate spam from legitimate massages would present significant changes."
